# ASRExercises

This is a collection of different (classification) algorithms, implemented as part of the course on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) 
at the Nuremberg Institute of Technology (TH NÃ¼rnberg).

* Gaussian: A probabilistic classifier based gaussian_classify distribution
* KNN: K-Nearest-Neighbour classifier
* MLP: Mulit-layer Perceptron

Both classifiers are using the TIMIT Corpus.
